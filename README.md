# CHARACTER CLASSIFIER
**Superhero Character classifier**
- This is a binary image classifier model deployed on streamlit as a web application
- The Superheroes I have used are Spider-Man and Batman who are the two most popular characters from the Marvel-DC lore
- The Dataset I have used is a custom set of Images for each character extracted from Google Images
- The model architecture is saved in the  `model.json` file
- the model weights are saved in a `model.hdd5` file
- The Data Directory has the Custom Image set for both characters
- The App is available at ~ https://charclassifier-5gv4v66zpisfeuqv8jceqw.streamlit.app/
