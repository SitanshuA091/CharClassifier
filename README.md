# CHARACTER CLASSIFIER
**Superhero Character classifier**
- This is a binary image classifier model deployed on streamlit as a web application
- The Superheroes I have used are Spider-Man and Batman who are the two most popular characters from the Marvel-DC lore
- The Dataset I have used is a custom set of Images for each character extracted from Google Images
- The Jupyter Notebook has all the preprocessing tasks and Data preparation pipeline as well as the model-building steps from building the architecture to compiling after defining the training arguments and finally the training step
- The model is saved as a .keras file
- The Data Directory has the Custom Image set for both characters
