**Superhero Character classifier**
- This is a binary image classifier model deployed on streamlit as a web application

- The Dataset I have used is a custom set of Images for each character extracted from Google Images
- The Jupyter Notebook has all the preprocessing tasks and Data preparation pipeline as well as the model-building steps from building the architecture to compiling after defining the training arguments and finally the training step
- The model architecture is saved as a json file
- the model weights are saved in a hdd5 file
- The Data Directory has the Custom Image set for both characters
