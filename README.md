SUPERHERO CHARCTER CLASSIFIER
This repository contains code for preprocessing data, building a machine learning model, and creating a Streamlit application for interactive visualization.

Files
ClassifierNotebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing code for data preprocessing tasks.
SHClassifier.py: Python file containing code for the Streamlit application.
Usage
Data Preprocessing, Model Building and Determining accuracy 
Open preprocessing_notebook.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
Execute the code cells to perform data preprocessing tasks such as cleaning, feature engineering, and data transformation.
Model Building
Ensure that the preprocessed data is available or load any custom required dataset.
Execute the Streamlit application by running the following command in your terminal:
Copy code
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
